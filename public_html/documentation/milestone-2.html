		<h1>PWP Milestone 2</h1>
		<h1>Content Strategy</h1>
			<p>My site will be one page, and consist of a header with links, a body with relevant professional
					and some personal information to seek employment, and a picture, possibly a few pictures on an
					auto slide show.  The background of the body will be an image to be decided later.  Each section
					will have its own personal image as long as it's not too distracting or it will just have one
					overall theme.  The site will also be able to track number of visits.</p>
			<p><strong>Page Header:</strong>  The page will start off with a header that contains
					"Meet Mauricio Madrid" or something to that affect as an introduction.  The header will be
					filled in with a solid color.  The header will also contain links to all the relevant sections;
					Resume, Portfolio, Project, About Me, Contact, and Sign In.</p>
			<p><strong>Picture Section</strong>  The picture section will be placed just below the header on the
					right side of the page.  It will consist of 2-4 pictures.  Just below the picture there will be a
					picture selector of some sort giving the user a choice to select different pictures at random.
					The pictures maybe placed on some sort of auto slide show.</p>
			<p><strong>Resume:</strong>  A general resume to highlight my technical details and work
					history/experience.</p>
			<p><strong>Portfolio:</strong>   A portfolio section to display previous work, accomplishments, and
					completed projects.  This section will have colored background.</p>
			<p><strong>Project:</strong>  A project section to display current projects in development and
					future projects that are being considered.</p>
			<P><strong>About Me:</strong>  An about me section that will highlight my personal and possibly
					professional travels with pictures and/or slide shows to highlight my interests.
					This section will have colored background.</P>
			<p><strong>Contact:</strong>  A contact section to let my target audience know how to reach me with all
					the current and relevant contact information.</p>
			<p><strong>Sign In:</strong>  A sign in section to let people sign my page so I know who visited and a
					way to contact them for follow up purposes.</p>
		<h1>Wireframe</h1>
			<p>This site will feature one layout that will be fully responsive on small and large screens.
					The wireframes were created using
