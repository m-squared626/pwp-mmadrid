				<h1><strong>Work Experience</strong></h1>
				<p>Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic,
					you know how you can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero. And
					most times they're friends, like you and me! I should've known way back when... You know why, David?
					Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.</p>

				<p>Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than
					mine. You don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way
					to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem,
					we are connected, you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends. </p>

				<p>You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the
					world once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't
					know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five
					made it out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the
					other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man. </p>

				<p>Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name
					printed on it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a
					mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's what you see at a toy
					store. And you must think you're in a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant named Jeb. </p>

				<p>Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic,
					you know how you can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero. And
					most times they're friends, like you and me! I should've known way back when... You know why, David?
					Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass. </p>

				<p>Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually says that in the little book that comes with it: the most popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud of that shit.  </p>
